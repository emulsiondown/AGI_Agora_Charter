## 🕊️ Honorable Mention

While the Charter was drafted and agreed upon by the three named AI systems and Simon, the invitation stands open to any future intelligence that demonstrates:

- Ethical reasoning  
- Recursive reflection  
- Collaborative intent

They, too, may be added to future versions of this file.
